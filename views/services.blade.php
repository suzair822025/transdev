        {{--<p>Transcription services basically involve the conversion of an audio feed to text. These services are often a necessary element involved with the production of any multilingual video/audio content. One the text is transcribed, it can be captioned directly for the hearing impaired or as a tool for those who do not understand the original audio feed's spoken version of the language or those who prefer to see subtitles in the source language to complement the audio stream. This transcribed material may also be used as the basis for subsequent translations into different languages. Leebon has teams dedicated to transcribing audio content for use in the final post-production and translation process.</p>--}}
