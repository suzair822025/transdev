            <h2 class="h2">Legal</h2>
            <p>Courts are the final hope for people who wish to sort things out in a justifying and legal manner. The judgment of any case depends on various factors & reasons. Documentation and evidence are the backbones of any legal pleas or cases. The transcription is done by a transcriber who has a legal background and legal transcription expertise. The content is then fully reviewed by a second legal transcriber.</p>
